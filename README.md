I'm an Offensive Security Researcher and Cybersecurity grad student at NYU, passionate about hands-on, high-impact work. From reverse engineering firmware to building autonomous red team tools, I love diving deep into security problems and creating powerful solutions.

🔍 I specialize in **penetration testing**, **reverse engineering**, and **threat detection**—whether it's cracking encrypted configs in router firmware or designing LLM-based recon agents for Hack The Box.

💬 I like to think of myself as a curious hacker, someone who’s always learning, building, and breaking things (responsibly, of course).

**Fun fact:** I once broke a classifier’s accuracy by 70% with adversarial attacks. 😈
